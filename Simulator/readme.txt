Look at the nested class at line 99
It is called algStrategy and it uses the backtrader.Strategy class (documentation page)
Backtrader quickstart is also great documentation that explains a lot of the syntax

Tasks needed
- Be able to create own algorithm 
- Be able to give the user the option to choose a different algorithm
(There is documentation for adding and choosing strategies in backtrader)
- There is a total need of 3 different algs that is required by the UI.
(1 is implemented already)
- If any changes or would like to do something else, just let everyone know.

Notes
* Either maintain the encapsulation format currently used or maintain the functions
found at the bottom of the program.

What is output.csv?
Mostly everything found printed in the console is written into a csv for data usages.
